# Anti-Phishing-Trainer
## Names: Chaipakon Luangprasert, Daniel Cox

1. What are you trying to do?
I’m planning to develop a program that organizations can use to train their employee against
phishing attacks. Due to my current skills, I don’t think I should try to come up with the top-tier
cybersecurity software, but rather a software that is not too complicated and will be useful to
people.
2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently organizations use anti-phishing software, the software can detect and block
suspicious content. The limitation is that the software just simply can’t detect 100% of phishing
attacks.
3. What is new in your approach?
Rather than building software to detect the attacks, I’m building software to trains users to be
aware and careful of the phishing attacks.
4. What’s you evaluation plan (when applicable)?
We can simply launch attacks against trained organizations and see how they react to the
attack. (Of course, when applicable)
