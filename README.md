# Anti-Phishing-Trainer
## Names: Chaipakon Luangprasert, Daniel Cox

What are you trying to do?
We want to develop a program that organizations can use to train their employees against phishing attacks. Given the current scope of this project, we won't aim for top notch cybersecurity software, but rather an app that is simple and functional.

How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently organizations use anti-phishing software. The software can detect and block suspicious content. The limitation is that the software simply can’t detect 100% of phishing attacks.

What is new in your approach?
Rather than building software to detect the attacks, we're building software to train users to be aware and careful of various kinds phishing attacks.

What’s your evaluation plan (when applicable)?
We can simply launch attacks against trained organizations and see how they react to the attack. The reponses can be recorded through the organization.
